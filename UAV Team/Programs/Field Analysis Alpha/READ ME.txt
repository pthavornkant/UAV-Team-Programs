UAV IMAGING PROGRAM ALPHA STAGE
======================================
by Patrick Thavornkant


This alpha takes an image of a crop field and modifies it's RGB color values. 

A "bad crop" is considered to be a gray-white pixel amongst the crops in the field, therefore we search for those pixel values.
I set it so that these pixel values are approximately read as (100, 100, 100) for RGB.

This is a very preliminary program, and lacks many features. It likely will not run on your computer unless you modify the search path for images.


Furthermore, it requires JAR files I have made mention of in the OpenCV Java commands text file on Box.

This stage of the program is only being uploaded as a proof of work and so that those who want to see the code, can.
